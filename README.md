# MVVM-sample
MVVM with Architectural Components: Room, LiveData, ViewModel, Retrofit, DataBinding.

First and foremost, I wanna point out that why it is MVVM-sample but not another pattern.
Indeed, rise of Jetpack's Architectural Components eliminated other architectural patterns(i.e., MVP & MVC), 
so there are tons of guides to apply MVVM. I keep it simple, and 
put ui components little bit perplex but they are reflection of other commodities in the market.
I've created many classes, it may seem such overmuch but when you work on a major project, 
architecture must be clean as much as code and MUST be obeyed to the SOLID principles which will guide you to design every class to be responsible on spesific task(S). 
This diagram represents how MVVM looks like on Android development. I won't spend my time to diagram my every classes, but the system exactly work like this. 
Enjoy it, i know it could be completed but there's no time to waste with Java. This is probably my last time on Java/Android, and it is the beginning of Kotling era to me.

*Especially, i want to notice that there is a list- which have an own layout(viewholder) interchangeable with another one. This technique is being used on many apps on the market,
quite honestly, i don't have an idea what their way of doing that, it's my approach but i'm not pretentious.
